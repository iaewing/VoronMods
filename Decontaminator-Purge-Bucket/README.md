# Decontaminator Purge Bucket Mod

![Picture of mod](Images/purge_bucket_300mm.jpg)

This is a small modification to the 300mm purge bucket by [edwardyeeks](https://github.com/edwardyeeks) to accomodate the bed Wagos. I've also increased the magnet spot size to make it less likely to crack when inserting magnets.

## BOM

Print `300mm.stl` purge bucket instead of the default. The right side bucket is slightly narrower to accomodate the bed Wagos.
